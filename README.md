# **Cold Email and Cover Letter Generator**

This project is a web-based tool designed to help job applicants generate personalized cold emails and cover letters for job applications in the tech industry. It extracts job postings from URLs, processes the data using AI, and matches the applicantâ€™s portfolio based on required skills. The solution uses machine learning models, ChromaDB for portfolio storage, and LangChain for natural language generation. Additionally, the tool leverages Groq for AI model integration.

## **Features**
- **Job URL Parsing:** Allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page to extract job listings.
- **Portfolio Matching:** Uses ChromaDB to store and query portfolio links based on the required skills for the job position.
- **AI-Powered Email Generation:** Uses LangChain and Groq to generate personalized cold emails, including relevant portfolio links.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Provides an interactive and easy-to-use web interface for uploading portfolios, inputting job URLs, and viewing generated content.
